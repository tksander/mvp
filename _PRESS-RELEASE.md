There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Strava Fitness Challenge (SFC)

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  SFC allows Strava users the capability to challenge their fellow Strava users to fitness challenges. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Generate friendly rivalries with fellow Strava users by challenging them to keep up with your fitness activity. SFC tracks users Strava acitivity
  throughout the week and visualizes the data against your friend's data. Whether it is your friend down the street, your brother across the country,
  or co-worker/classmate, you'll have one location to track and compete against the other person. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Fitness can become a dull, ardous, mind-numbing weekly task. Today's fitness community is obsessed with group based fitness like Soul Cycle and 
  Yoga studios. However, we often are unable to afford or make it to these group classes. Moreover, we have fitness apps to help us track our activity
, but these apps are often bloated with many features. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  The power of group fitness can be brought to you by pairing with a fitness partner and using the wonders of peer 
  pressure to encourage fitness and engage in a little fun rivalry. SFC also separates out the fitness tracking metrics
  from the challenge app, allowing you to focus on the fun of the rivalry and not the fitness tracking itself. 


## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  SFC simplifies your fitness life. Focus on a fitness challenge and not the fitness app itself. 

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Simply go to the SFC website, sign in with your Strava account, add your friend to the challenge, and you are off! Go for a run or ride and see 
  your stats appear next to your challenger. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I challneged my sister on SFC and was immediately addicted! We would constantly check the stats and see who logged more miles
  or elevation for that week. It added a new element to my fitness"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Finding a sustainable, consistent, fun source of exercise can be difficult with today's busy schedules. Get back to the fun of competing with SFC. 
  Go to SFC.com and challenge a friend!
